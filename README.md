# Todo Browser Extension
  
  > Todo application to create quick tasks in a browser extension

  > The current project only presents a very basic functioning CRUD app.
    
  ## Packages used
  > express-react-views

  > mongoose
  
  > express
  
  > method-override
  
  > react

  > react-dom

**Issues**
  - This is a completely barebones app.
  - The stylesheet designed for the app does not connect:
  ```
  The resource from “http://localhost:4545/css/style.css” was blocked due to MIME type (“text/html”) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).
  ```


## Future development
  - In Projects 3 and 4 I intend to build this out to make it a Firefox extension.
  - The various compenents will be further modulated so that functionality is increased and the code is DRYer.
